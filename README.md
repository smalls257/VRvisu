# VRvisu: A Virtual Reality Based Software of Medical Data Visualization

<!--

Current data visualization techniques rely on two-dimensional spaces to relay information. As the amount of data gets larger and more complex, these techniques tend to become less useful. VRvisu attempts to solve this problem by visualizing data in three-dimensional space using virtual reality (VR). By leveraging VR, this program currently generates two visualizations. They include, a 3D scatterplot of a tumor dataset and a clustering visualization of related genes.

Please Note: VRvisu is currently being prepped for upload. 

### Hardware Requirements

VRvisu currently requires the following hardware. 

```
HTC Vive
VR-Ready Computer
Leap Motion Camera
```
 <!--
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Features

```
3D Scatterplot with custom models
Clustering Visualization
Smartwatch menu
Interactable Datapoints
Data-tooltips/windows

```

## Creating a Visualization

VRvisu has been designed with ease of use in mind. Upon the start of the program the user is in an empty space. On the left wrist is a smart watch menu that can be used to select different options and create a visualization. Once a visualization has been selected a "shell" of the graph is created. This shell includes directions to set-up the visualization and choose the file, options, scale, etc.


## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) - Primarily for games, this framework was used to create VRvisu


## Contributing

VRvisu will be ready for contributions after everything has been prepped and uploaded. Please wait to contribute to this project.
